## Description

A NoSQL social network type back-end made using MongoDB and Mongoose.  With multiple routes to add, update and delete Users, thoughts, and reactions.

## Install and Usage

To install the application you will have to clone the repository.  Once the repository is cloned open your terminal in the main directory of the reopsitory and run "npm i".  After it is finished installing you will be able to run the application with "npm start".  Currently there is no front-end so to tes the routes you will need to use a software similar to Insomnia.
